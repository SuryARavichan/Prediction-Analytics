# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical diagnostic data. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not. It uses a combination of:
- Data exploration
- Preprocessing
- SVM model building
- Evaluation metrics

The project was built in Python using the Scikit-learn library and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2)) 🏦 Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning (SVM)

This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant information. It is designed to help automate decision-making in the loan approval process using historical data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions handle thousands of loan applications daily. This project focuses on automating loan approvals using supervised learning techniques. It uses the `loan_prediction.csv` dataset to train a model that can accurately classify loan applications as either "Approved" or "Rejected".

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `loan_prediction.csv`
- **Source:** Loan prediction dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Target Variable:** `Loan_Status` (Y: Approved, N: Rejected)

### 🔑 Key Features:
- Gender, Marital Status, Dependents  
- Education, Self-Employed  
- Applicant & Co-applicant Income  
- Loan Amount & Loan Term  
- Credit History  
- Property Area 


3)) 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a machine learning model to detect **fraudulent credit card transactions** using logistic regression. The goal is to classify whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction features.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major financial crime that requires effective detection methods. Using a real-world dataset, this project applies **logistic regression** to perform **binary classification**. The model handles highly imbalanced data and evaluates performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `creditcard.csv`
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- **Classes:**  
  - `0` → Legitimate  
  - `1` → Fraudulent  

---

## 🧠 Features

- Anonymized input features (`V1` to `V28`)
- `Time` and `Amount` are non-transformed features
- `Class` is the binary target variable
