# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical diagnostic data. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not. It uses a combination of:
- Data exploration
- Preprocessing
- SVM model building
- Evaluation metrics

The project was built in Python using the Scikit-learn library and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
